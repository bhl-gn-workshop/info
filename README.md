# BHL/GN workshop 2019 cheatsheet

## General Information

See the [workshop web page](https://globalnames.org/workshops) for logistics.

Our workshop is about leveraging resources of Biodiversity Heritage Library and lexical tools of Global Names project to work on BHL texts for data-mining and improving quality of its metadata.

I think this year was special from the scientific name occurances metadata perspective, but also name-finding project helps now to figure out better ways for everybody to mobilize BHL data and metadata.

## BHL Data and Metadata Mobilization

Before we can do work on whole corpus of BHL data and metadata we need to get this data on our local computer. Here are resources that can help with the process.
